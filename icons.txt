UI TODO:
Automatic fullscreen


Bug found:
If you try to push an object from one place to another during the loading screen, due to the way i lazily programmed this it cancels the load screen out

This is a known bug that i will NOT try to fix yet because im really sick and tired of this project

the snack bars fonts are really small
